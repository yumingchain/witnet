# Server address tells what local interface and port the Witnet node server should bind to.
# This will probably look like `0.0.0.0:21337` or `192.168.x.x:21337`, but it totally depends on your local network.
server_addr = "0.0.0.0:21337"
# Public address needs to match your *public* IP and port, assuming your router is configured to forward incoming
# connections to the local IP of the device the node is running. Failure to configure this setting will result in your
# node not receiving inbound connections (see: https://docs.witnet.io/try/run-a-node/#open-your-ports).

# List of bootstrap peer addresses. The first time that a node runs, it connects to some of these addresses and query
# them for a list of all the addresses they know. From that moment on, the addresses listed here are not given any
# preference over addresses that have been discovered in any way.
