# Witnet-rust Development Roadmap

Witnet is an open initiative and Witnet-rust is and an open source project that will be developed by Witnet Foundation in collaboration with a number of other organizations and independent developers. This means that Witnet Foundation can't set the roadmap unilaterally.

However, Witnet Foundation has a strong commitment to ensure the following milestones are met:

- ~~__September 2018__: a user-facing demo/prototype that will let users explore the potential of the protocol being built.~~ Done! [Sheikah desktop client is already out][sheikah]!
- __2019 Q1__ `testnet-1`: a functional test network implementing the essential features of the Witnet protocol.
- __2019 Q3__: bridge node software for Ethereum and RChain.
- __2019 Q4__: `mainnet` release.

_Given the experimental nature of the technologies and network protocols under development, these dates and deliverables may be subject to change due to reasons beyond the control of Witnet Foundation._
