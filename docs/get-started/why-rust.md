# Why Rust?

Having its own underlying blockchain, Witnet requires code that is as fast as C or C++ but memory safe to prevent
security vulnerabilities. At the same time, we want to produce concurrent code that can take advantage of modern
hardware.

After analyzing the possible languages to use, we found that Rust is a fast, memory safe and highly concurrent language
which allows for writing complex multithreaded code without race conditions or dangling pointers. It allows fearless
concurrency without compromising on performance.

Having an undeniable influence from functional languages like ML or Haskell, Rust is very expressive yet it uses high
level abstractions. This makes it easy to write correct and readable code, which in turn translates into faster and more
productive development.

Rust is statically typed but it sports a really nice type inferer which makes code succinct and readable.

The absence of a garbage collector and low runtime requirements makes it easy to embed Rust code inside other languages
like Python, Ruby or Nodejs. This is fundamental for building the bridges between Witnet and other blockchains as well
as with the headless browser that will allow Witnet to perform web content retrievals.

The Rust compiler is simply awesome, offering the most helpful messages we have seen in a compiler. It also has
incremental compilation, which helps developers save their valuable time.

No more reinventing the wheel. Unlike C or C++, Rust has a package manager — a tool called cargo. Besides managing the
dependencies of the project, cargo gives you the option to build, run, test, generate documentation and publish your own
 package to a community driven package repository.

Metaprogramming. Rust macros allow for reusing code in a concise, well-abstracted way with a powerful compile-time
correctness checking.

And last but not least, Rust has an ever-welcoming community that is always willing to help and is currently growing at
a very healthy pace. In addition, it is currently in a stage in which the ecosystem is mature enough so that you d

Summing up, here are the 8 reasons why Witnet will make the most of Rust:

* Performance
* Memory safety
* Concurrency
* Influence from functional languages
* Statically typed with type inference
* Awesome compiler and tooling
* Metaprogramming
* Thriving community
